# Quantum Emblem
"Quantum Emblem" is a quantum strategy game inspired in the fantasy tactical role-playing game Fire Emblem. We modified the game's mechanics in order to take advantage of the quantum phenomena. We also added the possibility to add quantum logic gates to modify the soldiers' states. All this brings more tactics to the game, which will depend mainly on luck.
